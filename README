The main program is window.py. Hitting "snapshot" generates
a postscript file in the current directory.
 
test-closest-parallel.py and test-closest-nonparallel.py get
random lines in the square and draw them and the red line
connecting the two lines. You can check if it's working by
visual inspection. To speed up or slow down, change the DELAY.

The arrowhead goes from the first point on the line to the
second point and is extremely useful if you're trying to
debug the quadratic minimizer thing in shortestline.

The other two scripts are crude unit tests that check a few
things.
